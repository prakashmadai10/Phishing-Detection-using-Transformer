# Data Sources

OpenPhish will provide 500 malicious URLs for free in TXT form. You can access that data [here](https://openphish.com/phishing_database.html).

Likewise, PhishTank is an excellent resource that provides a daily feed of malicious URLs in CSV or JSON format. You can gather ~5K through the following [link](https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php).


Finally, there is an excellent OpenSource project, [Phishing.Database](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database), run by Mitchell Krog. There is a ton of data available here to plus up your dataset.
